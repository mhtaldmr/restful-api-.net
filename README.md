# RestFul API Design

This project is an example of using  ***Restful API*** principles.

In the project the main theme is Formula 1 (a.k.a F1 or Formula One) Motor Racing elements.

### What I have used so far:
- Asp.Net Core Web API with `.Net5.0` framework.
- No Database used in this project.
- To be able to use Restful APIs, dummy datas generated in Data Folder.
- To test the APIs, *Swagger* and *Postman* has been used.
- To be able to serialize objects, *JsonPatch* and *NewtonsoftJson* packages has been used.


## Requirements
- This project must have Restful standarts.
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods must be used.
- Must be following Http staus code standarts.
- 200,201,400,404,500 Status codes must be showed.
- Required fields must be checked.
- Routing must be used.
- Model binding must be used both FromQuery and FromBody.
- Listing and Filtering can be used as Bonus.

## Installation and Usage

To get the project :
```
    git clone https://github.com/mhtaldmr/restful-api-.net.git
```
To reach the project folder :
```
    cd restful-api-.net 
    cd MuhammetAliDemir.TP.Net.Homework
```
To run the project:
- If you are using the Visual Studio, just press **F5** or press **Start Debugging**.

- If you are using terminal : 
```
    dotnet run
```
- The port will be listening on : https://localhost:5001

## API Endpoints

* All the http mehtods and return types in requirements are represented in the project.
<br>
*  Examples of endpoints like:

- To be able to use Patch methods, JsonPatch and NewtonsoftJson Packages installed.
- Adding the service of this package to Startup.cs file:
```
    services.AddControllers().AddNewtonsoftJson();
```
- Updating a spesific field by using Patch method:
```c
        //.../Drivers/id
        [HttpPatch("{id}")] 
        public IActionResult UpdateDriverWithJsonPatch( int id,[FromBody] JsonPatchDocument<Driver> driverToPatch)
        {
            var driver = Drivers.Where(d => d.Id == id).SingleOrDefault();

            if(driver is null)
                return BadRequest($"This driver with id = {id} doesnt exist in the list!");

            //To apply the changes
            driverToPatch.ApplyTo(driver);
            return Ok(driver); //Http 200
        }
```
- In the body of the Patch, the parameters need to be written:
```c
    [ {"op": "replace","path": "/Name", "value": "Mercedes" } ]
```

 - For more information about JsonPatch methods visit : [JsonPatch in Asp.Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/jsonpatch?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
<br>

- Filtering and sorting a team example:
```c
        //.../Teams/list?powerunit=
        [HttpGet("list")]
        public IActionResult GetTeamByPowerUnit([FromQuery] string powerUnit)
        {
            var teams = Teams.Where(r => r.PowerUnit == powerUnit)
                             .OrderByDescending(r => r.Championship)
                             .ToList();

            if (powerUnit is null)
                return NotFound("You didnt enter any input into the form!");

            //If there is NOT a team in the list, we will get : http 404 Not Found Error
            if (teams.Count == 0 )
                return NotFound($"There is no team in the list with input = {powerUnit}!");

            return Ok(teams); //http 200
        }
```

* In terms of 500 Internal Server Code, it defined by a StatusCode method.
```c
    public IActionResult InternalServiceError()
    {
        return StatusCode(500,"500 Internal Server Error Occured!"); //Http 500
    }
```


## Data Model

I have used 3 entity in this project to define Driver, Race and Team.
- All entities must have **required** fields such as Id and Name:
```c
    public class <EntityName>
    {
        [Required]
        public int Id { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
```
- Since these fields are common, these fields can be seperated by an BaseEntity and Inherited others.

- Drivers can have;
    * Team, Nationality, RaceEntered, Podiums, Championship

- Races can have;
    * Location, Length, NumberOfLaps, LapRecord, FirstRaceAt

- Teams can have;
    * PowerUnit, Country, TeamChief, Drivers, Championship
